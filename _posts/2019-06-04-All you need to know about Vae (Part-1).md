In this part of the blog, we will discuss the basics of the VAE. And in the next section, we will implement VAE in a molecular generation.
Vae is a type of generative model which helps us to generate a similar type of input data. It helps to generate similar images, similar text etc.
A generative model is a way of learning similar data distribution of input data so that it generates new similar type of data.
VAEs also make a probability distribution of input data, and from that distribution, we create samples which is taking data from this distribution and generate new data similar to input data.
